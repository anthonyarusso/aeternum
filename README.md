Welcome to the `mvp` branch. M.V.P. stands for "minimum viable product". This is essentially Aeternum's rough draft "v1" implementation to experiement with different choices of libraries and plugins. This branch also exists to test preliminary "proof of concept" features such as the centeral "time manipulation" mechanic.
